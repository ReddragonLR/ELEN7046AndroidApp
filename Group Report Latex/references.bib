abstract={We provide an overview of the estimation methods that software companies apply to estimate their projects, why those methods are chosen, and how accurate they are. In order to improve estimation accuracy, such knowledge is essential. We conducted an in-depth survey, where information was collected through structured interviews with senior managers from 18 different companies and project managers of 52 different projects. We analyzed information about estimation approach, effort estimation accuracy and bias, schedule estimation accuracy and bias, delivered functionality and other estimation related information. Our results suggest, for example, that average effort overruns are 41%, that the estimation performance has not changed much the last 10-20 years, that expert estimation is the dominating estimation method, that estimation accuracy is not much impacted by use of formal estimation models, and that software managers tend to believe that the estimation accuracy of their company is better than it actually is.},

abstract={Over the past decades large investments in software engineering research and development have been made by academia and the software industry. These efforts have produced considerably insight in the complex domain of software development, and have paid off in the shape of the improved tools, languages, methodologies and techniques. However, a recent review of estimation survey documents that less progress has been made in the area of estimation performance. This is a major concern for the software industry, as lack of estimation performance often causes budget overruns, delays, lost contracts or poor quality software. Because of these rather dramatic consequences, there is a high demand for more research on the topic of effort estimation in software development projects. That demand motivated this PhD. The thesis is written at the Estimation Group at Simula Research Laboratory in Oslo, Norway. The work is supervised by professor Magne Jorgensen, and is part of the SPIKE (Software Process Improvement based on Knowledge and Experience) project which is funded by the Norwegian Research Council},

abstract={The Complex Adaptive Situational Model (CASM) promotes understanding of establishing conditions which enable software engineering success. Influenced by complexity science, CASM explains aspects of the state of dynamic equilibrium that is achieved under constraining influence of management and production governance. Four states of dynamic equilibrium are defined: Crafted Quality (Agile), Controlled Quality (waterfall), Managed Costs (WetAgile) and Self-Directed Quality. A band of software engineering feasibility is also described and it is suggested that successful software engineering initiatives require teams to operate in that band. The journey across the band of feasibility is explained by introducing SEMAT, with Crafted Quality amounting to applying SEMAT Essence, and Controlled Quality being achieved by introducing additional practices which satisfy the more stringent governance requirements. An enterprise is then described as a collection of CAS's, thereby setting the scene for further research into the complexities of human-driven complex adaptive systems.},
